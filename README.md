# resrepo

This library is designed to facilitate the implementation of good practices in 
maintaining a research repository on git.

For the moment, to install the package, you will have to set it up a project on your computer
using RStudio, and then install it. The vignette (work in progress) explains how
to structure the repository as well as showing off the library functionalities in
helping with setting up and using a repository.
