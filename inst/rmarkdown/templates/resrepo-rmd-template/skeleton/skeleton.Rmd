## resrepo-specific notes

### YAML options

The `knit: resrepo::knit_to_results` line causes this document to knit to a directory under results. This output directory will have the same name as the filename of this Rmd document, e.g. `s01_process_data`.

The `output: pdf_document` line sets the output to a PDF document. Output options include: `pdf_document`; `html_document`; `github_document`; `word_document`. For more information see https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/output-formats.html.

### setting directories

In this chunk we define the input and output directories: 

* `data_dir`: data folders where inputs for this document's code are; 
* output folder where any e.g. intermediate data files should be saved.

```{r set-directories}

## set the relative filepath to the input data directory for this analysis
dir_data <- path_resrepo("/data/raw/default")
dir_data # print out

## and similar for where the outputs
dir_output <- path_resrepo("/data/intermediate/processed_data")

```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
