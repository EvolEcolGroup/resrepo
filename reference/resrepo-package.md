# resrepo: Easy git repo management for reproducible science

A package to manage git repositories used for research that contain a
with a mix of code and data. resrepo is based on a well documented
template with clear guidelines on how the repository should be
structured, what file naming conventions to use, and how to manage large
data that can not be stored in git repositories, encouraging
reproducible science. In particular, resrepo provides tools to ensure
that data are available and up-to-date both locally and in the cloud, as
well as simplifying the process of locating directories within the
repository from R scripts.
